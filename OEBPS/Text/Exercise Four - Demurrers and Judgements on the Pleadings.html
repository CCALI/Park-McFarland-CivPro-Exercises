    <h2 id="heading_id_2">EXERCISE FOUR -&nbsp;Demurrers and Judgments on the Pleadings</h2>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>This computer aided exercise presents a defamation action in the state of Dakota.&nbsp; The facts are the same as in Exercise Three, except that the action is filed in state court instead of federal court.&nbsp; Peter Schuler, a former student at Dakota College, claims that David Dour, a professor at the college, called him a user of crack cocaine.&nbsp; As the exercise progresses, the computer will describe the pleadings filed by the parties and ask you to identify the issues that would be raised on challenges to those pleadings.</p>

    <p>Dakota is a code pleading state, so the first challenge to plaintiff’s pleading will be a demurrer by defendant.&nbsp; Later you will be asked to consider a motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; Since this exercise explores code pleading, it will be of special interest to students planning to practice in a code pleading state.&nbsp; Relevance to students planning to practice in a rules state will be less direct.&nbsp; Indeed, in a rules state, Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(c) provided until 2007 that&nbsp; “[d]emurrers, pleas, and exceptions for insufficiency of a pleading shall not be used.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref" title="">[i]</a>&nbsp; Even so<a id="Four1">,</a> this exercise has value for students focusing on rules procedures.&nbsp; The code procedure is historically enlightening and provides instructive contrast with rules procedure.&nbsp; This exercise considers both.&nbsp; Even if you have studied only federal pleading, you will be able to do this exercise.&nbsp; The preliminary text will tell you what you need to know about code pleading.</p>

    <p>Please read the following description of Dakota's substantive and procedural law.&nbsp; Then answer the preliminary questions below, before going to the computer to begin <a href="http://www.cali.org/lesson/378">CALI CIV 02: Demurrers and Judgments on the Pleadings</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="heading_id_3">I. SUBSTANTIVE LAW</h3>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>The substantive law of defamation in the state of Dakota is discussed in Exercise Three, part III.B.&nbsp; <a href="../Text/Exercise%20Three%20-%20Pleading%20a%20Complaint.html#defamation">Please reread those pages</a>.</p>

    <p>In reaction to the dictum in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc</em>., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) [<a href="../Text/Exercise%20Three%20-%20Pleading%20a%20Complaint.html#dictum"><em>see</em> Exercise Three, part III.B.2]</a>, the Supreme Court of Dakota recognized a defense of due care.&nbsp; This means that even should defendant Dour's statement be found false and not privileged, defendant still prevails if he exercised due care in attempting to ascertain that the statement was true.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 id="heading_id_4">II. PROCEDURAL LAW</h3>

    <h4 id="heading_id_5">A. Burden of Pleading</h4>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>In Dakota, plaintiff has the burden of pleading the elements of slander (publication, falsity, disparagement, and pecuniary damage/slander &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>per se</em>).&nbsp; Defendant has the burden of pleading the affirmative defenses of truth,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref" title="">[ii]</a> privilege<a id="Four2">,</a> and due care.&nbsp; When defendant raises the affirmative defense of qualified privilege, plaintiff has the burden of pleading malice to overcome the privilege.</p>

    <p>To say that a party has the burden of pleading on a given issue means that the party must raise that issue in the pleadings, or the issue will be resolved against the party.&nbsp; Dakota follows the rule that ambiguities in the pleadings are to be resolved against the pleader<a id="Four3">.</a><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref" title="">[iii]</a></p>

    <h4 id="heading_id_6">B. Sequence of Code Pleadings and Motions</h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Under Dakota law, plaintiff commences the action by filing a complaint.&nbsp; Defendant may respond with a special demurrer (raising issues that do not go to the merits, such as lack of jurisdiction or improper joinder), with a general demurrer (challenging the legal sufficiency of the complaint, as discussed below), or with an answer.&nbsp; In the answer, defendant must raise any affirmative defenses or they will be waived.&nbsp; When defendant does not raise any affirmative defenses, the pleadings close with the answer.&nbsp; When defendant raises affirmative defenses, plaintiff is required to file a reply, denying or avoiding<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref" title="">[iv]</a> the averments of the affirmative defenses<a id="Four4">.</a>&nbsp; This reply closes the pleadings<a id="Four5">.</a><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref" title="">[v]</a>&nbsp; Since the defendant is not permitted to respond to the reply, the allegations in the reply are taken as denied or avoided by the defendant.</p>

    <p>After the pleadings have closed, either party may move for judgment on the pleadings.</p>

    <h4 id="heading_id_7">C. The General Demurrer</h4>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>Dakota's general demurrer is a procedural device used by the defendant to challenge the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint.&nbsp; Only issues of law may be decided;&nbsp; the demurrer is not a method of testing the facts.&nbsp; The usual maxim "law for the judge, facts for the jury" applies.&nbsp; The general demurrer is defendant's way of saying to plaintiff, "Admitting for the moment that all of the facts alleged in your complaint are true, you are still not entitled to relief as a matter of law."&nbsp; Put more colloquially, defendant is saying "Yeah, so what!"</p>

    <p>The purpose of the general demurrer is to allow early dismissal of a complaint that is insufficient on its face.&nbsp; Suppose that the complaint alleges "The defendant stuck out his tongue.&nbsp; This caused me severe emotional distress.&nbsp; Therefore, I am entitled to damages."&nbsp; Even if these facts were true, the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief.&nbsp; The sooner the case is dismissed, the better.&nbsp; The defendant should not be required to file an answer, undergo discovery, and prepare for trial without being able to get a determination about whether the plaintiff's complaint is legally sufficient.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>At common law, filing a general demurrer was a daring step, since defendant thereby made a binding concession that the facts alleged by the plaintiff were true.&nbsp; When the court decided the facts pleaded by plaintiff did support relief, defendant had lost.&nbsp; Under modern pleading systems, defendant no longer faces sudden death if the demurrer is not sustained.&nbsp; Defendant is still allowed to file an answer denying that the facts alleged in the complaint are true.</p>

    <p>When the demurrer is sustained, the court will usually grant the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the defect(s) in the pleading, so a demurrer is particularly useful when defendant believes plaintiff has pleaded all of the facts that she could conceivably prove.&nbsp; Should plaintiff's legal theory be tenuous, the demurrer allows both parties to obtain a ruling on the legal sufficiency of the cause of action<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title="">[vi]</a> without incurring the expense of trial<a id="Four6">.</a>&nbsp; The general demurrer is thus functionally equivalent to the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>

    <p>Dakota follows the traditional rule that a demurrer cannot be a "speaking motion," that is, matters outside the challenged pleading can never be presented to the court for its consideration on a demurrer.&nbsp; A demurrer to a complaint examines only the face of the complaint.&nbsp; All of the facts asserted are taken to be true for purposes of deciding the legal sufficiency of the complaint<a id="Four7">.</a><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title="">[vii]</a></p>

    <h4 id="heading_id_8">D. The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</h4>

    <p><br /></p>

    <p>After the pleadings have closed, either party may make a motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; The motion may be used by the defendant as a sort of hang fire demurrer, or by the plaintiff to challenge the legal sufficiency of the defendant's answer.</p>

    <p>As with the demurrer, the motion for judgment on the pleadings cannot "speak<a id="Four8">.</a>"<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title="">[viii]</a> &nbsp;The allegations of the party opposing the motion are taken as true;&nbsp; resolution of factual issues is reserved for trial.&nbsp; Nor can the movant rely upon an affirmative allegation in her pleading, unless it is admitted by the adversary.&nbsp; For example, suppose plaintiff sues defendant on a theory of invasion of privacy, alleging defendant used plaintiff's photograph for advertising purposes without permission.&nbsp; If defendant admits using the photograph but raises an affirmative defense, plaintiff would be entitled to judgment on the pleadings when her complaint is legally sufficient and defendant's affirmative defense is legally insufficient.&nbsp; If the defendant denied using the photograph, however, the plaintiff would be bound by that denial for purposes of the motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; Plaintiff could not introduce extrinsic evidence that the photograph had been used.</p>

    <p>The motion for judgment on the pleadings "searches the pleadings."&nbsp; When plaintiff makes a motion for judgment on the pleadings, she exposes herself to the possibility that her complaint will be dismissed.&nbsp; Before examining the sufficiency of the defendant's answer, the court examines the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint, and if the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action, it will be dismissed.&nbsp; A bad answer is good enough to withstand a bad complaint.</p>

    <p>The general demurrer and the motion for judgment on the pleadings are not the only means for weeding out non meritorious cases before trial.&nbsp; The motion for summary judgment is a more effective device.&nbsp; Summary judgment is the subject of <a href="../Text/Exercise%20Eight%20-%20Summary%20Judgement.html">Exercise Eight</a>.</p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p>Q&ndash;4. In ruling on the demurrer, could the trial court properly decide whether a disparaging statement has to be false to be actionable?</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Answer yes or no.</p>

P. 8(a)(2) requires "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."&nbsp; For discussion of cause of action and claim, &nbsp;<em>see</em> <a href="../Text/Exercise%20Three%20-%20Pleading%20a%20Complaint.html#codepleading">Exercise Three, part I.B to I.C.</a><a href="../Text/Exercise%20Four%20-%20Demurrers%20and%20Judgements%20on%20the%20Pleadings.html#Four6">(Return to text)</a></p>

      <p class="sgc-1">If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.&nbsp; All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.</p>
